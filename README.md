"package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes. The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. Finally, MAJORs add changes that won’t work with earlier versions.


To allow an npm dependency to update to the latest PATCH version, you can prefix the dependency’s version with the tilde (~) character. Here's an example of how to allow updates to any 1.3.x version.

"package": "~1.3.8"

## middleware

Basically, middleware are functions that intercept route handlers, adding some kind of information. A middleware needs to be mounted using the method app.use(path, middlewareFunction). The first path argument is optional. If you don’t pass it, the middleware will be executed for all requests.
