# Backend

"package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes. The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. Finally, MAJORs add changes that won’t work with earlier versions.


To allow an npm dependency to update to the latest PATCH version, you can prefix the dependency’s version with the tilde (~) character. Here's an example of how to allow updates to any 1.3.x version.

"package": "~1.3.8"

## middleware

Basically, middleware are functions that intercept route handlers, adding some kind of information. A middleware needs to be mounted using the method app.use(path, middlewareFunction). The first path argument is optional. If you don’t pass it, the middleware will be executed for all requests.



In Express, you can put in place this functionality using the middleware express.static(path), where the path parameter is the absolute path of the folder containing the assets.
app.use('/public', express.static(__dirname+'/public'))


Middleware functions are functions that take 3 arguments: the request object, the response object, and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions execute some code that can have side effects on the app, and usually add information to the request or response objects. They can also end the cycle by sending a response when some condition is met. If they don’t send the response when they are done, they start the execution of the next function in the stack. This triggers calling the 3rd argument, next().

Look at the following example:

function(req, res, next) {
  console.log("I'm a middleware...");
  next();
}

When a request matches the route, it displays the string “I’m a middleware…”, then it executes the next function in the stack. In this exercise, you are going to build root-level middleware. As you have seen in challenge 4, to mount a middleware function at root level, you can use the app.use(<mware-function>) method. In this case, the function will be executed for all the requests, but you can also set more specific conditions. For example, if you want a function to be executed only for POST requests, you could use app.post(<mware-function>). Analogous methods exist for all the HTTP verbs (GET, DELETE, PUT, …).

```
app.use((req,res,next)=>{
  console.log(req.method+' '+req.path+ ' - ' +req.ip);
  next()
})
```



Middleware can be mounted at a specific route using app.METHOD(path, middlewareFunction). Middleware can also be chained within a route definition.

Look at the following example:

app.get('/user', function(req, res, next) {
  req.user = getTheUserSync();  // Hypothetical synchronous operation
  next();
}, function(req, res) {
  res.send(req.user);
});



Middleware can also be chained within a route definition

app.get('/user', function(req, res, next) {
  req.user = getTheUserSync();  // Hypothetical synchronous operation
  next();
}, function(req, res) {
  res.send(req.user);
});


When building an API, we have to allow users to communicate to us what they want to get from our service. For example, if the client is requesting information about a user stored in the database, they need a way to let us know which user they're interested in. One possible way to achieve this result is by using route parameters. Route parameters are named segments of the URL, delimited by slashes (/). Each segment captures the value of the part of the URL which matches its position. The captured values can be found in the req.params object.

route_path: '/user/:userId/book/:bookId'
actual_request_URL: '/user/546/book/6754'
req.params: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}


Get Query Parameter Input from the Client
Another common way to get input from the client is by encoding the data after the route path, using a query string. The query string is delimited by a question mark (?), and includes field=value couples. Each couple is separated by an ampersand (&). Express can parse the data from the query string, and populate the object req.query. Some characters, like the percent (%), cannot be in URLs and have to be encoded in a different format before you can send them. If you use the API from JavaScript, you can use specific methods to encode/decode these characters.

route_path: '/library'
actual_request_URL: '/library?userId=546&bookId=6754'
req.query: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}

Note: In the following exercise you are going to receive data from a POST request, at the same /name route path. If you want, you can use the method app.route(path).get(handler).post(handler). This syntax allows you to chain different verb handlers on the same path route. You can save a bit of typing, and have cleaner code.


Use body-parser to Parse POST Requests
Besides GET, there is another common HTTP verb, it is POST. POST is the default method used to send client data with HTML forms. In REST convention, POST is used to send data to create new items in the database (a new user, or a new blog post).

In these kind of requests, the data doesn’t appear in the URL, it is hidden in the request body. The body is a part of the HTTP request, also called the payload. Even though the data is not visible in the URL, this does not mean that it is private. To see why, look at the raw content of an HTTP POST request:

POST /path/subpath HTTP/1.0
From: john@example.com
User-Agent: someBrowser/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 20

name=John+Doe&age=25
As you can see, the body is encoded like the query string. This is the default format used by HTML forms. With Ajax, you can also use JSON to handle data having a more complex structure. There is also another type of encoding: multipart/form-data. This one is used to upload binary files. In this exercise, you will use a URL encoded body. To parse the data coming from POST requests, you must use the body-parser package. This package allows you to use a series of middleware, which can decode data in different formats.

Tip: There are several other http methods other than GET and POST. And by convention there is a correspondence between the http verb, and the operation you are going to execute on the server. The conventional mapping is:

POST (sometimes PUT) - Create a new resource using the information sent with the request,

GET - Read an existing resource without modifying it,

PUT or PATCH (sometimes POST) - Update a resource using the data sent,

DELETE => Delete a resource.

There are also a couple of other methods which are used to negotiate a connection with the server. Except from GET, all the other methods listed above can have a payload (i.e. the data into the request body). The body-parser middleware works with these methods as well.

```
let express = require('express');
let app = express();
let bodyParser = require('body-parser')

console.log("Hello World")

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))

app.use((req,res,next)=>{
  console.log(req.method+' '+req.path+ ' - ' +req.ip); 
  next()
})
app.use('/public', express.static(__dirname+'/public'))

app.get('/', (req, res)=>{
  res.sendFile(__dirname+'/views/index.html')
})

app.get('/json', (req,res)=>{
  if(process.env.MESSAGE_STYLE=='uppercase')
    res.json({'message': 'HELLO JSON'})
else res.json({"message": "Hello json"})
})

app.get('/now', (req, res, next)=>{
  req.time = new Date().toString()
  next()
},(req,res)=>{
  res.json({time: req.time})
})

app.get('/:word/echo', (req,res)=>{
  res.json({echo:req.params.word})
})

app.route('/name')
  .get((req, res)=>{
  res.json({
    name: req.query.first+' '+req.query.last
  })
})
.post((req, res)=>{
// console.log(req.body)
  const name1 = req.body.first +  ' ' + req.body.last
  res.json({
    name: name1
  })
})
```


# MongoDB and Mongoose

## CRUD Part I - CREATE

First of all we need a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection. It defines the shape of the documents within that collection. Schemas are building block for Models. They can be nested to create complex models, but in this case we'll keep things simple. A model allows you to create instances of your objects, called documents.

Replit is a real server, and in real servers the interactions with the database happen in handler functions. These functions are executed when some event happens (e.g. someone hits an endpoint on your API). We’ll follow the same approach in these exercises. The done() function is a callback that tells us that we can proceed after completing an asynchronous operation such as inserting, searching, updating, or deleting. It's following the Node convention, and should be called as done(null, data) on success, or done(err) on error.

Warning - When interacting with remote services, errors may occur!

/* Example */

const someFunc = function(done) {
  //... do something (risky) ...
  if (error) return done(error);
  done(null, result);
};

## Create Many Records with model.create()
Sometimes you need to create many instances of your models, e.g. when seeding a database with initial data. Model.create() takes an array of objects like [{name: 'John', ...}, {...}, ...] as the first argument, and saves them all in the db.

## Use model.find() to Search Your Database
In its simplest usage, Model.find() accepts a query document (a JSON object) as the first argument, then a callback. It returns an array of matches. It supports an extremely wide range of search options. Read more in the docs.

## Use model.findById() to Search Your Database By _id
When saving a document, MongoDB automatically adds the field _id, and set it to a unique alphanumeric key. Searching by _id is an extremely frequent operation, so Mongoose provides a dedicated method for it.


## Perform Classic Updates by Running Find, Edit, then Save
In the good old days, this was what you needed to do if you wanted to edit a document, and be able to use it somehow (e.g. sending it back in a server response). Mongoose has a dedicated updating method: Model.update(). It is bound to the low-level mongo driver. It can bulk-edit many documents matching certain criteria, but it doesn’t send back the updated document, only a 'status' message. Furthermore, it makes model validations difficult, because it just directly calls the mongo driver.
