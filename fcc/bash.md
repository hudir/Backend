You can see what's in a file with more <filename>. Use it to view what's in the package.json file.


That's a lot of folders. You can add a flag to a command to use it different ways like this: ls <flag>. List the contents of the node_modules folder in "long list format". Do that by adding the -l flag to the "list" command.

The . takes you to the folder you are in, and .. takes you back, or up, a folder. 
```
.  ..  .gitignore  index.html  index.js  styles.css
```

You don't need the old images folder anymore. You can use rmdir <directory_name> to remove a folder. rmdir stands for "remove directory". Try to remove the images folder with rmdir. Make sure it's the one in the website folder.

You can print to a file instead of the terminal with echo text >> filename. Use it to print I made this boilerplate to your README.md file.

Use the "exit" command to exit the terminal.
